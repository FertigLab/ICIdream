Small synthetic dataset provided by challenge organizers. From the challenge data [page](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn18404605/wiki/607227):

> **Synthetic Data**
>  - To facilitate data ingest by participant models we have made a small synthetic data that has the same formatting as the real validation data that can be download here. We highly recommend using this data to test if your method can read in the testing data locally before submitting your model to the Challenge queues.
>  - A larger synthetic dataset also resides in the submission system and participant's Dockerized predictors will run on it during synthetic validation phase. Log files related to execution on the synthetic data will be returned to participants.
>  - In the final validation phase where real validation is used participant's Docker containers will be run on the larger synthetic set first to ensure they execute without error before running on the true validation data. Again log files will be produce related to the synthetic validation only.
